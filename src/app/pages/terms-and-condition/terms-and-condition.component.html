            <p>Yesterday I saw a film titled Macbeth. Its story elements are interesting. The films hero, Macbeth, assassinates Duncan and ascends to the throne of Scotland. But he is dissatisfied.

The message it conveys is that excessive ambition destroys a man. The actor and actress who played Macbeth and Lady Macbeth had exceptional performances, which significantly increased the film’s impact.</p>
